# Fuzzy Flappy Bird
## Simple python game inspired by flappy bird with fuzzy logic based AI

Run the game with 'python3 app.py' command.

This small project is supposed to present basic fuzzy logic concepts. Controller takes three input values:

        - current ball's speed
        - height of next gap's center relative to ball's position
        - distance to the next wall

and outputs the value of ball's booster that enables the ball to travel safely through the gaps.

Press space after the ball crashes to restart the game.
Use up and down arrow keys to disturb ball's vertical movement.
Change 'manual' variable to 'True' in app.py to disable the controller (and use up arrow key to play the game).
